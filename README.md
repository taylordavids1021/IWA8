# IWA8
IWA_8.2: Challenge 1

# Going back to the previous exercise, and armed with the knowledge of JavaScript object literals, it becomes clear how we can use object literals to better organise our data. Therefore, to ensure that you fully understand the literal object syntax please fix the code below (once again, only underneath the comment) so that it is able to console.log both the new leo and sarah objects in the browser console, followed by their respective postal codes.

 

# Unfortunately at the moment, when running the code snippet we get the following error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

 

# Note that the new objects should have a nested address object that contains all address-specific information, i.e. street name, house number and postal code. Also, note that all values in the object should be reassigned from the variables at the top of the file. The only exception is the new age value that is added to the object. In the latter, we assign a value directly when declaring the object.
